<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Basic/SyncScope.h' l='24'>/// Defines synch scope values used internally by clang.
///
/// The enum values start from 0 and are contiguous. They are mainly used for
/// enumerating all supported synch scope values and mapping them to LLVM
/// synch scopes. Their numerical values may be different from the corresponding
/// synch scope enums used in source languages.
///
/// In atomic builtin and expressions, language-specific synch scope enums are
/// used. Currently only OpenCL memory scope enums are supported and assumed
/// to be used by all languages. However, in the future, other languages may
/// define their own set of synch scope enums. The language-specific synch scope
/// values are represented by class AtomicScopeModel and its derived classes.
///
/// To add a new enum value:
///   Add the enum value to enum class SyncScope.
///   Update enum value Last if necessary.
///   Update getAsString.
