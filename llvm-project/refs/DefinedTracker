<doc f='llvm/clang/lib/Lex/PPExpressions.cpp' l='78'>/// DefinedTracker - This struct is used while parsing expressions to keep track
/// of whether !defined(X) has been seen.
///
/// With this simple scheme, we handle the basic forms:
///    !defined(X)   and !defined X
/// but we also trivially handle (silly) stuff like:
///    !!!defined(X) and +!defined(X) and !+!+!defined(X) and !(defined(X)).</doc>
