<doc f='llvm/llvm/tools/llvm-objcopy/MachO/Object.h' l='118'>/// The location of the bind info inside the binary is described by
/// LC_DYLD_INFO load command. Dyld binds an image during the loading process,
/// if the image requires any pointers to be initialized to symbols in other
/// images. The bind information is a stream of byte sized opcodes whose
/// symbolic names start with BIND_OPCODE_. Conceptually the bind information is
/// a table of tuples: &lt;seg-index, seg-offset, type, symbol-library-ordinal,
/// symbol-name, addend&gt; The opcodes are a compressed way to encode the table by
/// only encoding when a column changes.  In addition simple patterns like for
/// runs of pointers initialized to the same value can be encoded in a few
/// bytes.</doc>
