<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang-c/Index.h' l='4420'>/**
 * Retrieve the canonical cursor corresponding to the given cursor.
 *
 * In the C family of languages, many kinds of entities can be declared several
 * times within a single translation unit. For example, a structure type can
 * be forward-declared (possibly multiple times) and later defined:
 *
 * \code
 * struct X;
 * struct X;
 * struct X {
 *   int member;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * The declarations and the definition of \c X are represented by three
 * different cursors, all of which are declarations of the same underlying
 * entity. One of these cursor is considered the &quot;canonical&quot; cursor, which
 * is effectively the representative for the underlying entity. One can
 * determine if two cursors are declarations of the same underlying entity by
 * comparing their canonical cursors.
 *
 * \returns The canonical cursor for the entity referred to by the given cursor.
