<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/ProfileData/InstrProfData.inc' l='637'>/* Profile version is always of type uint64_t. Reserve the upper 8 bits in the
 * version for other variants of profile. We set the lowest bit of the upper 8
 * bits (i.e. bit 56) to 1 to indicate if this is an IR-level instrumentaiton
 * generated profile, and 0 if this is a Clang FE generated profile.
 * 1 in bit 57 indicates there are context-sensitive records in the profile.
