 * The version constants for the libclang API.
 * CINDEX_VERSION_MINOR should increase when there are API additions.
 * CINDEX_VERSION_MAJOR is intended for &quot;major&quot; source/ABI breaking changes.
 *
 * The policy about the libclang API was always to keep it source and ABI
 * compatible, thus CINDEX_VERSION_MAJOR is expected to remain stable.
