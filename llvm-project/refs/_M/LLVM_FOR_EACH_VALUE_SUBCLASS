 * @defgroup LLVMCCoreValues Values
 *
 * The bulk of LLVM&apos;s object model consists of values, which comprise a very
 * rich type hierarchy.
 *
 * LLVMValueRef essentially represents llvm::Value. There is a rich
 * hierarchy of classes within this type. Depending on the instance
 * obtained, not all APIs are available.
 *
 * Callers can determine the type of an LLVMValueRef by calling the
 * LLVMIsA* family of functions (e.g. LLVMIsAArgument()). These
 * functions are defined by a macro, so it isn&apos;t obvious which are
 * available by looking at the Doxygen source code. Instead, look at the
 * source definition of LLVM_FOR_EACH_VALUE_SUBCLASS and note the list
 * of value names given. These value names also correspond to classes in
 * the llvm::Value hierarchy.
