 * Determine the lexical parent of the given cursor.
 *
 * The lexical parent of a cursor is the cursor in which the given \p cursor
 * was actually written. For many declarations, the lexical and semantic parents
 * are equivalent (the semantic parent is returned by
 * \c clang_getCursorSemanticParent()). They diverge when declarations or
 * definitions are provided out-of-line. For example:
 *
 * \code
 * class C {
 *  void f();
 * };
 *
 * void C::f() { }
 * \endcode
 *
 * In the out-of-line definition of \c C::f, the semantic parent is
 * the class \c C, of which this function is a member. The lexical parent is
 * the place where the declaration actually occurs in the source code; in this
 * case, the definition occurs in the translation unit. In general, the
 * lexical parent for a given entity can change without affecting the semantics
 * of the program, and the lexical parent of different declarations of the
 * same entity may be different. Changing the semantic parent of a declaration,
 * on the other hand, can have a major impact on semantics, and redeclarations
 * of a particular entity should all have the same semantic context.
 *
 * In the example above, both declarations of \c C::f have \c C as their
 * semantic context, while the lexical context of the first \c C::f is \c C
 * and the lexical context of the second \c C::f is the translation unit.
 *
 * For declarations written in the global scope, the lexical parent is
 * the translation unit.
