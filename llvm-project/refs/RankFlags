<doc f='llvm/lld/ELF/Writer.cpp' l='896'>// We compute a rank for each section. The rank indicates where the
// section should be placed in the file.  Instead of using simple
// numbers (0,1,2...), we use a series of flags. One for each decision
// point when placing the section.
// Using flags has two key properties:
// * It is easy to check if a give branch was taken.
// * It is easy two see how similar two ranks are (see getRankProximity).</doc>
