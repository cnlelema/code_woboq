      /// The DECL_OFFSET constant describes the record that occurs
      /// within the block identified by DECL_OFFSETS_BLOCK_ID within
      /// the AST block. The record itself is an array of offsets that
      /// point into the declarations and types block (identified by
      /// DECLTYPES_BLOCK_ID). The declaration ID is an index into this
      /// record, after subtracting one to account for the use of
      /// declaration ID 0 for a NULL declaration pointer. Index 0 is
      /// reserved for the translation unit declaration.</doc>
