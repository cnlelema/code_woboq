<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Analysis/ConstructionContext.h' l='184'>/// Construction context can be seen as a linked list of multiple layers.
/// Sometimes a single trigger is not enough to describe the construction
/// site. That&apos;s what causing us to have a chain of &quot;partial&quot; construction
/// context layers. Some examples:
/// - A constructor within in an aggregate initializer list within a variable
///   would have a construction context of the initializer list with
///   the parent construction context of a variable.
/// - A constructor for a temporary that needs to be both destroyed
///   and materialized into an elidable copy constructor would have a
///   construction context of a CXXBindTemporaryExpr with the parent
///   construction context of a MaterializeTemproraryExpr.
/// Not all of these are currently supported.
/// Layers are created gradually while traversing the AST, and layers that
/// represent the outmost AST nodes are built first, while the node that
/// immediately contains the constructor would be built last and capture the
/// previous layers as its parents. Construction context captures the last layer
/// (which has links to the previous layers) and classifies the seemingly
/// arbitrary chain of layers into one of the possible ways of constructing
/// an object in C++ for user-friendly experience.</doc>
