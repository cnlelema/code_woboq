<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Analysis/AliasAnalysis.h' l='1087'>/// A manager for alias analyses.
///
/// This class can have analyses registered with it and when run, it will run
/// all of them and aggregate their results into single AA results interface
/// that dispatches across all of the alias analysis results available.
///
/// Note that the order in which analyses are registered is very significant.
/// That is the order in which the results will be aggregated and queried.
///
/// This manager effectively wraps the AnalysisManager for registering alias
/// analyses. When you register your alias analysis with this manager, it will
/// ensure the analysis itself is registered with its AnalysisManager.
///
/// The result of this analysis is only invalidated if one of the particular
/// aggregated AA results end up being invalidated. This removes the need to
/// explicitly preserve the results of `AAManager`. Note that analyses should no
/// longer be registered once the `AAManager` is run.</doc>
