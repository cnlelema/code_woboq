<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU/AMDKernelCodeT.h' l='289'>/// If requiredWorkgroupSize is not enabled then all elements for Dim3 must be
  /// 0, and the produced code can be dispatched with any legal work-group range
  /// consistent with the dispatch dimensions. Otherwise, the code produced must
  /// always be dispatched with the specified work-group range. No element of the
  /// specified range must be 0. It must be consistent with required_dimensions
  /// and max_flat_workgroup_size. If the kernel being finalized, or any of the
  /// functions it calls, has a requiredworkgroupsize control directive, then the
  /// values must be the same. Specifying a value can allow the finalizer to
  /// optimize work-group id operations, and if the number of work-items in the
  /// work-group is less than the WAVESIZE then barrier operations can be
  /// optimized to just a memory fence.</doc>
