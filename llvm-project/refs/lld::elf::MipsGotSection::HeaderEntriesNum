  // contains different types of entries. Here is a layout of GOT:
  // - Header entries                |
  // - Page entries                  |   Local part
  // - Local entries (16-bit access) |
  // - Local entries (32-bit access) |
  // - Normal global entries         ||  Global part
  // - Reloc-only global entries     ||
  // - TLS entries                   ||| TLS part
  //
  // Header:
  //   Two entries hold predefined value 0x0 and 0x80000000.
  // Page entries:
  //   These entries created by R_MIPS_GOT_PAGE relocation and R_MIPS_GOT16
  //   relocation against local symbols. They are initialized by higher 16-bit
  //   of the corresponding symbol&apos;s value. So each 64kb of address space
  //   requires a single GOT entry.
  // Local entries (16-bit access):
  //   These entries created by GOT relocations against global non-preemptible
  //   symbols so dynamic linker is not necessary to resolve the symbol&apos;s
  //   values. &quot;16-bit access&quot; means that corresponding relocations address
  //   GOT using 16-bit index. Each unique Symbol-Addend pair has its own
  //   GOT entry.
  // Local entries (32-bit access):
  //   These entries are the same as above but created by relocations which
  //   address GOT using 32-bit index (R_MIPS_GOT_HI16/LO16 etc).
  // Normal global entries:
  //   These entries created by GOT relocations against preemptible global
  //   symbols. They need to be initialized by dynamic linker and they ordered
  //   exactly as the corresponding entries in the dynamic symbols table.
  // Reloc-only global entries:
  //   These entries created for symbols that are referenced by dynamic
  //   relocations R_MIPS_REL32. These entries are not accessed with gp-relative
  //   addressing, but MIPS ABI requires that these entries be present in GOT.
  // TLS entries:
  //   Entries created by TLS relocations.
  //
  // If the sum of local, global and tls entries is less than 64K only single
  // got is enough. Otherwise, multi-got is created. Series of primary and
  // multiple secondary GOTs have the following layout:
  // - Primary GOT
  //     Header
  //     Local entries
  //     Global entries
  //     Relocation only entries
  //     TLS entries
  //
  // - Secondary GOT
  //     Local entries
  //     Global entries
  //     TLS entries
  // ...
  //
  // All GOT entries required by relocations from a single input file entirely
  // belong to either primary or one of secondary GOTs. To reference GOT entries
  // each GOT has its own _gp value points to the &quot;middle&quot; of the GOT.
  // In the code this value loaded to the register which is used for GOT access.
  //
  // MIPS 32 function&apos;s prologue:
  //   lui     v0,0x0
  //   0: R_MIPS_HI16  _gp_disp
  //   addiu   v0,v0,0
  //   4: R_MIPS_LO16  _gp_disp
  //
  // MIPS 64:
  //   lui     at,0x0
  //   14: R_MIPS_GPREL16  main
  //
  // Dynamic linker does not know anything about secondary GOTs and cannot
  // use a regular MIPS mechanism for GOT entries initialization. So we have
  // to use an approach accepted by other architectures and create dynamic
  // relocations R_MIPS_REL32 to initialize global entries (and local in case
  // of PIC code) in secondary GOTs. But ironically MIPS dynamic linker
  // requires GOT entries and correspondingly ordered dynamic symbol table
  // entries to deal with dynamic relocations. To handle this problem
  // relocation-only section in the primary GOT contains entries for all
  // symbols referenced in global parts of secondary GOTs. Although the sum
  // of local and normal global entries of the primary got should be less
  // than 64K, the size of the primary got (including relocation-only entries
  // can be greater than 64K, because parts of the primary got that overflow
  // the 64K limit are used only by the dynamic linker at dynamic link-time
  // and not by 16-bit gp-relative addressing at run-time.
