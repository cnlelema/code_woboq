/// This routine emits the given diagnostic when the code currently being
/// type-checked is &quot;potentially evaluated&quot;, meaning that there is a
/// possibility that the code will actually be executable. Code in sizeof()
/// expressions, code used only during overload resolution, etc., are not
/// potentially evaluated. This routine will suppress such diagnostics or,

/// This routine should be used for all diagnostics that describe the run-time
/// behavior of a program, such as passing a non-POD value through an ellipsis.
/// Failure to do so will likely result in spurious diagnostics or failures
/// during overload resolution or within sizeof/alignof/typeof/typeid.</doc>
