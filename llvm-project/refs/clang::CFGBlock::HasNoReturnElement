<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Analysis/CFG.h' l='693'>/// This bit is set when the basic block contains a function call
  /// or implicit destructor that is attributed as &apos;noreturn&apos;. In that case,
  /// control cannot technically ever proceed past this block. All such blocks
  /// will have a single immediate successor: the exit block. This allows them
