///
/// Instruction simplification has useful constraints in some contexts:
/// - It will never introduce *new* instructions.
/// - There is no need to iterate to a fixed point.
///
/// Many passes use instruction simplification as a library facility, but it may
/// also be useful (in tests and other contexts) to have access to this very
/// restricted transform at a pass granularity. However, for a much more
/// powerful and comprehensive peephole optimization engine, see the
/// `instcombine` pass instead.</doc>
