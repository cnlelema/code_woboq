/// A \c RecursiveASTVisitor that builds a map from nodes to their
/// parents as defined by the \c RecursiveASTVisitor.
///
/// Note that the relationship described here is purely in terms of AST
/// traversal - there are other relationships (for example declaration context)
/// in the AST that are better modeled by special matchers.
///
/// FIXME: Currently only builds up the map using \c Stmt and \c Decl nodes.</doc>
