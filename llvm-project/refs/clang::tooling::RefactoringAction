<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Tooling/Refactoring/RefactoringAction.h' l='19'>/// A refactoring action is a class that defines a set of related refactoring
/// action rules. These rules get grouped under a common umbrella - a single
/// clang-refactor subcommand.
///
/// A subclass of \c RefactoringAction is responsible for creating the set of
/// grouped refactoring action rules that represent one refactoring operation.
/// Although the rules in one action may have a number of different
/// implementations, they should strive to produce a similar result. It should
/// be easy for users to identify which refactoring action produced the result
/// regardless of which refactoring action rule was used.
///
/// The distinction between actions and rules enables the creation of action
/// that uses very different rules, for example:
///   - local vs global: a refactoring operation like
///     &quot;add missing switch cases&quot; can be applied to one switch when it&apos;s
///     selected in an editor, or to all switches in a project when an enum
///     constant is added to an enum.
///   - tool vs editor: some refactoring operation can be initiated in the
///     editor when a declaration is selected, or in a tool when the name of
///     the declaration is passed using a command-line argument.</doc>
