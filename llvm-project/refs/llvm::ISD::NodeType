  /// ISD::NodeType enum - This enum defines the target-independent operators
  /// for a SelectionDAG.
  ///
  /// Targets may also define target-dependent operator codes for SDNodes. For
  /// example, on x86, these are the enum values in the X86ISD namespace.
  /// Targets should aim to use target-independent operators to model their
  /// instruction sets as much as possible, and only use target-dependent
  /// operators when they have special requirements.
  ///
  /// Finally, during and after selection proper, SNodes may use special
  /// operator codes that correspond directly with MachineInstr opcodes. These
  /// are used to represent selected instructions. See the isMachineOpcode()
  /// and getMachineOpcode() member functions of SDNode.
