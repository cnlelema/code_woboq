<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang-c/Index.h' l='1091'>/**
 * Retrieve the replacement information for a given fix-it.
 *
 * Fix-its are described in terms of a source range whose contents
 * should be replaced by a string. This approach generalizes over
 * three kinds of operations: removal of source code (the range covers
 * the code to be removed and the replacement string is empty),
 * replacement of source code (the range covers the code to be
 * replaced and the replacement string provides the new code), and
 * insertion (both the start and end of the range point at the
 * insertion location, and the replacement string provides the text to
 * insert).
 *
 * \param Diagnostic The diagnostic whose fix-its are being queried.
 *
 * \param FixIt The zero-based index of the fix-it.
 *
 * \param ReplacementRange The source range whose contents will be
 * replaced with the returned replacement string. Note that source
 * ranges are half-open ranges [a, b), so the source code should be
 * replaced from a and up to (but not including) b.
 *
 * \returns A string containing text that should be replace the source
 * code indicated by the \c ReplacementRange.
