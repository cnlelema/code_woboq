<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang-c/Index.h' l='1516'>/**
 * Saves a translation unit into a serialized representation of
 * that translation unit on disk.
 *
 * Any translation unit that was parsed without error can be saved
 * into a file. The translation unit can then be deserialized into a
 * new \c CXTranslationUnit with \c clang_createTranslationUnit() or,
 * if it is an incomplete translation unit that corresponds to a
 * header, used as a precompiled header when parsing other translation
 * units.
 *
 * \param TU The translation unit to save.
 *
 * \param FileName The file to which the translation unit will be saved.
 *
 * \param options A bitmask of options that affects how the translation unit
 * is saved. This should be a bitwise OR of the
 * CXSaveTranslationUnit_XXX flags.
 *
 * \returns A value that will match one of the enumerators of the CXSaveError
 * enumeration. Zero (CXSaveError_None) indicates that the translation unit was
 * saved successfully, while a non-zero value indicates that a problem occurred.
