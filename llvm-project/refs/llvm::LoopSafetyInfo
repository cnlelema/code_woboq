<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Analysis/MustExecute.h' l='33'>/// Captures loop safety information.
/// It keep information for loop blocks may throw exception or otherwise
/// exit abnormaly on any iteration of the loop which might actually execute
/// at runtime.  The primary way to consume this infromation is via
/// isGuaranteedToExecute below, but some callers bailout or fallback to
/// alternate reasoning if a loop contains any implicit control flow.
/// NOTE: LoopSafetyInfo contains cached information regarding loops and their
/// particular blocks. This information is only dropped on invocation of
/// computeLoopSafetyInfo. If the loop or any of its block is deleted, or if
/// any thrower instructions have been added or removed from them, or if the
/// control flow has changed, or in case of other meaningful modifications, the
/// LoopSafetyInfo needs to be recomputed. If a meaningful modifications to the
/// loop were made and the info wasn&apos;t recomputed properly, the behavior of all
/// methods except for computeLoopSafetyInfo is undefined.</doc>
