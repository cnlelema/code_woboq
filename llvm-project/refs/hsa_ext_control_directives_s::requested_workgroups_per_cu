  /// finalizer is free to generate ISA that may result in any number of
  /// work-groups executing on a single compute unit. Otherwise, the finalizer
  /// should attempt to generate ISA that will allow the specified number of
  /// work-groups to execute on a single compute unit. This is only a hint and
  /// can be ignored by the finalizer. If the kernel being finalized, or any of
  /// the functions it calls, has a requested control directive, then the values
  /// must be the same. This can be used to determine the number of resources
  /// that should be allocated to a single work-group and work-item. For example,
  /// a low value may allow more resources to be allocated, resulting in higher
  /// per work-item performance, as it is known there will never be more than the
  /// specified number of work-groups actually executing on the compute
  /// unit. Conversely, a high value may allocate fewer resources, resulting in
  /// lower per work-item performance, which is offset by the fact it allows more
  /// work-groups to actually execute on the compute unit.</doc>
