<doc f='llvm/lld/COFF/InputFiles.cpp' l='669'>// Depending on the compilation flags, OBJs can refer to external files,
// necessary to merge this OBJ into the final PDB. We currently support two
// types of external files: Precomp/PCH OBJs, when compiling with /Yc and /Yu.
// And PDB type servers, when compiling with /Zi. This function extracts these
// dependencies and makes them available as a TpiSource interface (see
// DebugTypes.h). Both cases only happen with cl.exe: clang-cl produces regular
// output even with /Yc and /Yu and with /Zi.</doc>
