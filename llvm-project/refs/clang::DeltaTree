<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Rewrite/Core/DeltaTree.h' l='18'>/// DeltaTree - a multiway search tree (BTree) structure with some fancy
  /// features.  B-Trees are generally more memory and cache efficient than
  /// binary trees, because they store multiple keys/values in each node.  This
  /// implements a key/value mapping from index to delta, and allows fast lookup
  /// on index.  However, an added (important) bonus is that it can also
  /// efficiently tell us the full accumulated delta for a specific file offset
  /// as well, without traversing the whole tree.</doc>
