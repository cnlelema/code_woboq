<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Analysis/BlockFrequencyInfoImpl.h' l='343'>/// Unscaled probability weight.
  ///
  /// Probability weight for an edge in the graph (including the
  /// successor/target node).
  ///
  /// All edges in the original function are 32-bit.  However, exit edges from
  /// loop packages are taken from 64-bit exit masses, so we need 64-bits of
  /// space in general.
  ///
  /// In addition to the raw weight amount, Weight stores the type of the edge
  /// in the current context (i.e., the context of the loop being processed).
  /// Is this a local edge within the loop, an exit from the loop, or a
  /// backedge to the loop header?</doc>
