<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MC/MCDisassembler/MCDisassembler.h' l='29'>/// Ternary decode status. Most backends will just use Fail and
  /// Success, however some have a concept of an instruction with
  /// understandable semantics but which is architecturally
  /// incorrect. An example of this is ARM UNPREDICTABLE instructions
  /// which are disassemblable but cause undefined behaviour.
  ///
  /// Because it makes sense to disassemble these instructions, there
  /// is a &quot;soft fail&quot; failure mode that indicates the MCInst&amp; is
  /// valid but architecturally incorrect.
  ///
  /// The enum numbers are deliberately chosen such that reduction
  /// from Success-&gt;SoftFail -&gt;Fail can be done with a simple
  /// bitwise-AND:
  ///
  ///   LEFT &amp; TOP =  | Success       Unpredictable   Fail
  ///   --------------+-----------------------------------
  ///   Success       | Success       Unpredictable   Fail
  ///   Unpredictable | Unpredictable Unpredictable   Fail
  ///   Fail          | Fail          Fail            Fail
  ///
  /// An easy way of encoding this is as 0b11, 0b01, 0b00 for
  /// Success, SoftFail, Fail respectively.</doc>
