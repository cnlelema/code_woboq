<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang-c/Index.h' l='4384'>/**
 *  For a cursor that is either a reference to or a declaration
 *  of some entity, retrieve a cursor that describes the definition of
 *  that entity.
 *
 *  Some entities can be declared multiple times within a translation
 *  unit, but only one of those declarations can also be a
 *  definition. For example, given:
 *
 *  \code
 *  int f(int, int);
 *  int g(int x, int y) { return f(x, y); }
 *  int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
 *  int f(int, int);
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  there are three declarations of the function &quot;f&quot;, but only the
 *  second one is a definition. The clang_getCursorDefinition()
 *  function will take any cursor pointing to a declaration of &quot;f&quot;
 *  (the first or fourth lines of the example) or a cursor referenced
 *  that uses &quot;f&quot; (the call to &quot;f&apos; inside &quot;g&quot;) and will return a
 *  declaration cursor pointing to the definition (the second &quot;f&quot;
 *  declaration).
 *
 *  If given a cursor for which there is no corresponding definition,
 *  e.g., because there is no definition of that entity within this
 *  translation unit, returns a NULL cursor.
