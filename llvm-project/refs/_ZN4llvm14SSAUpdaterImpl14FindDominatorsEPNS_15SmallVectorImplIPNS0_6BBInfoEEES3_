<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Transforms/Utils/SSAUpdaterImpl.h' l='230'>/// FindDominators - Calculate the dominator tree for the subset of the CFG
  /// corresponding to the basic blocks on the BlockList.  This uses the
  /// algorithm from: &quot;A Simple, Fast Dominance Algorithm&quot; by Cooper, Harvey
  /// and Kennedy, published in Software--Practice and Experience, 2001,
  /// 4:1-10.  Because the CFG subset does not include any edges leading into
  /// blocks that define the value, the results are not the usual dominator
  /// tree.  The CFG subset has a single pseudo-entry node with edges to a set
  /// of root nodes for blocks that define the value.  The dominators for this
  /// subset CFG are not the standard dominators but they are adequate for
  /// placing PHIs within the subset CFG.</doc>
