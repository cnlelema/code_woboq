<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LoopFuse.cpp' l='113'>/// This class is used to represent a candidate for loop fusion. When it is
/// constructed, it checks the conditions for loop fusion to ensure that it
/// represents a valid candidate. It caches several parts of a loop that are
/// used throughout loop fusion (e.g., loop preheader, loop header, etc) instead
/// of continually querying the underlying Loop to retrieve these values. It is
/// assumed these will not change throughout loop fusion.
///
/// The invalidate method should be used to indicate that the FusionCandidate is
/// no longer a valid candidate for fusion. Similarly, the isValid() method can
/// be used to ensure that the FusionCandidate is still valid for fusion.</doc>
