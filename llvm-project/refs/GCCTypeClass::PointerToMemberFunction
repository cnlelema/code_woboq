<doc f='llvm/clang/lib/AST/ExprConstant.cpp' l='8430'>// GCC reserves 10 for functions, but does not use it since GCC version 6 due
  // to decay to pointer. (Prior to version 6 it was only used in C++ mode).
  // GCC claims to reserve 11 for pointers to member functions, but *actually*
  // uses 12 for that purpose, same as for a class or struct. Maybe it
  // internally implements a pointer to member as a struct?  Who knows.</doc>
