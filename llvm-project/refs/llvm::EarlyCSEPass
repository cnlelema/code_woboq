///
/// This pass does a simple depth-first walk over the dominator tree,
/// eliminating trivially redundant instructions and using instsimplify to
/// canonicalize things as it goes. It is intended to be fast and catch obvious
/// cases so that instcombine and other passes are more effective. It is
/// expected that a later pass of GVN will catch the interesting/hard cases.</doc>
