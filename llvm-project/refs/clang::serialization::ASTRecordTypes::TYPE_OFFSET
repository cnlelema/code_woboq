      /// The TYPE_OFFSET constant describes the record that occurs
      /// within the AST block. The record itself is an array of offsets that
      /// point into the declarations and types block (identified by
      /// DECLTYPES_BLOCK_ID). The index into the array is based on the ID
      /// of a type. For a given type ID @c T, the lower three bits of
      /// @c T are its qualifiers (const, volatile, restrict), as in
      /// the QualType class. The upper bits, after being shifted and
      /// subtracting NUM_PREDEF_TYPE_IDS, are used to index into the
      /// TYPE_OFFSET block to determine the offset of that type&apos;s
      /// corresponding record within the DECLTYPES_BLOCK_ID block.</doc>
