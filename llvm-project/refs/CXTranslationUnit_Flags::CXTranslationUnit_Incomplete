   * Used to indicate that the translation unit is incomplete.
   *
   * When a translation unit is considered &quot;incomplete&quot;, semantic
   * analysis that is typically performed at the end of the
   * translation unit will be suppressed. For example, this suppresses
   * the completion of tentative declarations in C and of
   * instantiation of implicitly-instantiation function templates in
   * C++. This option is typically used when parsing a header with the
   * intent of producing a precompiled header.
