  // &quot;0&quot; means operations that are not ready in this cycle are not considered
  // for scheduling (they go in the pending queue). Latency is paramount. This
  // may be more efficient if many instructions are pending in a schedule.
  //
  // &quot;1&quot; means all instructions are considered for scheduling regardless of
  // whether they are ready in this cycle. Latency still causes issue stalls,
  // but we balance those stalls against other heuristics.

  // estimate of highly machine specific characteristics such as the register
  // renaming pool and reorder buffer.</doc>
