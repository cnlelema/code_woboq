<doc f='llvm/llvm/tools/llvm-objcopy/MachO/Object.h' l='152'>/// The location of the lazy bind info inside the binary is described by
/// LC_DYLD_INFO load command. Some uses of external symbols do not need to be
/// bound immediately. Instead they can be lazily bound on first use.  The
/// lazy_bind contains a stream of BIND opcodes to bind all lazy symbols. Normal
/// use is that dyld ignores the lazy_bind section when loading an image.
/// Instead the static linker arranged for the lazy pointer to initially point
/// to a helper function which pushes the offset into the lazy_bind area for the
/// symbol needing to be bound, then jumps to dyld which simply adds the offset
/// to lazy_bind_off to get the information on what to bind.</doc>
