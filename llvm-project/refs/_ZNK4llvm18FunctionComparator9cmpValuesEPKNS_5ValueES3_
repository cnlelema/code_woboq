<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Transforms/Utils/FunctionComparator.h' l='228'>/// Assign or look up previously assigned numbers for the two values, and
  /// return whether the numbers are equal. Numbers are assigned in the order
  /// visited.
  /// Comparison order:
  /// Stage 0: Value that is function itself is always greater then others.
  ///          If left and right values are references to their functions, then
  ///          they are equal.
  /// Stage 1: Constants are greater than non-constants.
  ///          If both left and right are constants, then the result of
  ///          cmpConstants is used as cmpValues result.
  /// Stage 2: InlineAsm instances are greater than others. If both left and
  ///          right are InlineAsm instances, InlineAsm* pointers casted to
  ///          integers and compared as numbers.
  /// Stage 3: For all other cases we compare order we meet these values in
  ///          their functions. If right value was met first during scanning,
  ///          then left value is greater.
  ///          In another words, we compare serial numbers, for more details
