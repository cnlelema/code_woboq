<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/CodeGen/MachineFrameInfo.h' l='245'>/// The amount that a frame offset needs to be adjusted to
  /// have the actual offset from the stack/frame pointer.  The exact usage of
  /// this is target-dependent, but it is typically used to adjust between
  /// SP-relative and FP-relative offsets.  E.G., if objects are accessed via
  /// SP then OffsetAdjustment is zero; if FP is used, OffsetAdjustment is set
  /// to the distance between the initial SP and the value in FP.  For many
  /// targets, this value is only used when generating debug info (via
  /// TargetRegisterInfo::getFrameIndexReference); when generating code, the
  /// corresponding adjustments are performed directly.</doc>
