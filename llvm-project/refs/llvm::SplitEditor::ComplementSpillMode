<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/CodeGen/SplitKit.h' l='269'>/// ComplementSpillMode - Select how the complement live range should be
  /// created.  SplitEditor automatically creates interval 0 to contain
  /// anything that isn&apos;t added to another interval.  This complement interval
  /// can get quite complicated, and it can sometimes be an advantage to allow
  /// it to overlap the other intervals.  If it is going to spill anyway, no
