  /// A pipeline is defined as a series of names, each of which may in itself
  /// recursively contain a nested pipeline. A name is either the name of a pass
  /// (e.g. &quot;instcombine&quot;) or the name of a pipeline type (e.g. &quot;cgscc&quot;). If the
  /// name is the name of a pass, the InnerPipeline is empty, since passes
  /// cannot contain inner pipelines. See parsePassPipeline() for a more
  /// detailed description of the textual pipeline format.</doc>
