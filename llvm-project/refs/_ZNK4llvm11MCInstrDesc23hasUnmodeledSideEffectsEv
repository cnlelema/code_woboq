<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MC/MCInstrDesc.h' l='412'>/// Return true if this instruction has side
  /// effects that are not modeled by other flags.  This does not return true
  /// for instructions whose effects are captured by:
  ///
  ///  1. Their operand list and implicit definition/use list.  Register use/def
  ///     info is explicit for instructions.
  ///  2. Memory accesses.  Use mayLoad/mayStore.
  ///  3. Calling, branching, returning: use isCall/isReturn/isBranch.
  ///
  /// Examples of side effects would be modifying &apos;invisible&apos; machine state like
  /// a control register, flushing a cache, modifying a register invisible to
  /// LLVM, etc.</doc>
