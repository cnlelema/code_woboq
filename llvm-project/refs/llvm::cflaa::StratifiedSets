<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/Analysis/StratifiedSets.h' l='65'>/// These are stratified sets, as described in &quot;Fast algorithms for
/// Dyck-CFL-reachability with applications to Alias Analysis&quot; by Zhang Q, Lyu M
/// R, Yuan H, and Su Z. -- in short, this is meant to represent different sets
/// of Value*s. If two Value*s are in the same set, or if both sets have
/// overlapping attributes, then the Value*s are said to alias.
///
/// Sets may be related by position, meaning that one set may be considered as
/// above or below another. In CFL Alias Analysis, this gives us an indication
/// of how two variables are related; if the set of variable A is below a set
/// containing variable B, then at some point, a variable that has interacted
/// with B (or B itself) was either used in order to extract the variable A, or
/// was used as storage of variable A.
///
/// Sets may also have attributes (as noted above). These attributes are
/// generally used for noting whether a variable in the set has interacted with
/// a variable whose origins we don&apos;t quite know (i.e. globals/arguments), or if
/// the variable may have had operations performed on it (modified in a function
/// call). All attributes that exist in a set A must exist in all sets marked as
/// below set A.</doc>
