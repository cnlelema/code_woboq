/// - /*range=*/ will create an empty selection range in the default group

/// - /*range a=*/ will create an empty selection range in the &apos;a&apos; group right
///   after the comment.
/// - /*range = +1*/ will create an empty selection range at a location that&apos;s
///   right after the comment with one offset to the column.
/// - /*range= -&gt; +2:3*/ will create a selection range that starts at the
///   location right after the comment, and ends at column 3 of the 2nd line
///   after the line of the starting location.

/// Clang-refactor will expected all ranges in one test group to produce
