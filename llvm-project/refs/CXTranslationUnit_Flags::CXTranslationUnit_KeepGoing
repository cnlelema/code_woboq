   * Do not stop processing when fatal errors are encountered.
   *
   * When fatal errors are encountered while parsing a translation unit,
   * semantic analysis is typically stopped early when compiling code. A common
   * source for fatal errors are unresolvable include files. For the
   * purposes of an IDE, this is undesirable behavior and as much information
   * as possible should be reported. Use this flag to enable this behavior.
