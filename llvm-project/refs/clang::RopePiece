  // RopePiece Class
  //===--------------------------------------------------------------------===//

  /// RopePiece - This class represents a view into a RopeRefCountString object.
  /// This allows references to string data to be efficiently chopped up and
  /// moved around without having to push around the string data itself.
  ///
  /// For example, we could have a 1M RopePiece and want to insert something
  /// into the middle of it.  To do this, we split it into two RopePiece objects
  /// that both refer to the same underlying RopeRefCountString (just with
  /// different offsets) which is a nice constant time operation.</doc>
