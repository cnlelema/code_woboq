<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/Target/ARM/ARMTargetTransformInfo.h' l='50'>// Currently the following features are excluded from InlineFeatureWhitelist.
  // ModeThumb, FeatureNoARM, ModeSoftFloat, FeatureFP64, FeatureD32
  // Depending on whether they are set or unset, different
  // instructions/registers are available. For example, inlining a callee with
  // -thumb-mode in a caller with +thumb-mode, may cause the assembler to
  // fail if the callee uses ARM only instructions, e.g. in inline asm.</doc>
