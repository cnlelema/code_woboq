<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/ImmutableSet.h' l='185'>/// validateTree - A utility method that checks that the balancing and
  ///  ordering invariants of the tree are satisifed.  It is a recursive
  ///  method that returns the height of the tree, which is then consumed
  ///  by the enclosing validateTree call.  External callers should ignore the
  ///  return value.  An invalid tree will cause an assertion to fire in
  ///  a debug build.</doc>
