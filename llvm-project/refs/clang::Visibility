<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Basic/Visibility.h' l='23'>/// Describes the different kinds of visibility that a declaration
/// may have.
///
/// Visibility determines how a declaration interacts with the dynamic
/// linker.  It may also affect whether the symbol can be found by runtime
/// symbol lookup APIs.
///
/// Visibility is not described in any language standard and
/// (nonetheless) sometimes has odd behavior.  Not all platforms
/// support all visibility kinds.</doc>
