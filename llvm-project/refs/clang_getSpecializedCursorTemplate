<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang-c/Index.h' l='4796'>/**
 * Given a cursor that may represent a specialization or instantiation
 * of a template, retrieve the cursor that represents the template that it
 * specializes or from which it was instantiated.
 *
 * This routine determines the template involved both for explicit
 * specializations of templates and for implicit instantiations of the template,
 * both of which are referred to as &quot;specializations&quot;. For a class template
 * specialization (e.g., \c std::vector&lt;bool&gt;), this routine will return
 * either the primary template (\c std::vector) or, if the specialization was
 * instantiated from a class template partial specialization, the class template
 * partial specialization. For a class template partial specialization and a
 * function template specialization (including instantiations), this
 * this routine will return the specialized template.
 *
 * For members of a class template (e.g., member functions, member classes, or
 * static data members), returns the specialized or instantiated member.
 * Although not strictly &quot;templates&quot; in the C++ language, members of class
 * templates have the same notions of specializations and instantiations that
 * templates do, so this routine treats them similarly.
 *
 * \param C A cursor that may be a specialization of a template or a member
 * of a template.
 *
 * \returns If the given cursor is a specialization or instantiation of a
 * template or a member thereof, the template or member that it specializes or
 * from which it was instantiated. Otherwise, returns a NULL cursor.
