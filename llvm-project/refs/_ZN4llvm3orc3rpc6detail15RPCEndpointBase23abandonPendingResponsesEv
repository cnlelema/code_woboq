  /// This will call all currently registered result handlers to receive an
  /// &quot;abandoned&quot; error as their argument. This is used internally by the RPC
  /// in error situations, but can also be called directly by clients who are
  /// disconnecting from the remote and don&apos;t or can&apos;t expect responses to their
  /// outstanding calls. (Especially for outstanding blocking calls, calling
  /// this function may be necessary to avoid dead threads).</doc>
