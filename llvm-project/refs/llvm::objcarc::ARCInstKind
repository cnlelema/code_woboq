/// Equivalence classes of instructions in the ARC Model.

/// Since we do not have &quot;instructions&quot; to represent ARC concepts in LLVM IR,
/// we instead operate on equivalence classes of instructions.
///
/// TODO: This should be split into two enums: a runtime entry point enum
/// (possibly united with the ARCRuntimeEntrypoint class) and an enum that deals
/// with effects of instructions in the ARC model (which would handle the notion
/// of a User or CallOrUser).</doc>
