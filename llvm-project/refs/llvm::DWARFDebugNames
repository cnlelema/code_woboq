<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/DebugInfo/DWARF/DWARFAcceleratorTable.h' l='203'>/// .debug_names section consists of one or more units. Each unit starts with a
/// header, which is followed by a list of compilation units, local and foreign
/// type units.
///
/// These may be followed by an (optional) hash lookup table, which consists of
/// an array of buckets and hashes similar to the apple tables above. The only
/// difference is that the hashes array is 1-based, and consequently an empty
/// bucket is denoted by 0 and not UINT32_MAX.
///
/// Next is the name table, which consists of an array of names and array of
/// entry offsets. This is different from the apple tables, which store names
/// next to the actual entries.
///
/// The structure of the entries is described by an abbreviations table, which
/// comes after the name table. Unlike the apple tables, which have a uniform
/// entry structure described in the header, each .debug_names entry may have
/// different index attributes (DW_IDX_???) attached to it.
///
/// The last segment consists of a list of entries, which is a 0-terminated list
/// referenced by the name table and interpreted with the help of the
/// abbreviation table.</doc>
