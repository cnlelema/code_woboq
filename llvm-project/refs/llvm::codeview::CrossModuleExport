// This structure information allows cross-referencing between PDBs.  For
// example, when a PDB is being built during compilation it is not yet known
// what other modules may end up in the PDB at link time.  So certain types of
// IDs may clash between the various compile time PDBs.  For each affected
// module, a subsection would be put into the PDB containing a mapping from its
// local IDs to a single ID namespace for all items in the PDB file.</doc>
