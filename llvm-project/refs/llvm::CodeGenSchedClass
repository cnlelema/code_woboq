<doc f='llvm/llvm/utils/TableGen/CodeGenSchedule.h' l='101'>/// Scheduling class.
///
/// Each instruction description will be mapped to a scheduling class. There are
/// four types of classes:
///
/// 1) An explicitly defined itinerary class with ItinClassDef set.
/// Writes and ReadDefs are empty. ProcIndices contains 0 for any processor.
///
/// 2) An implied class with a list of SchedWrites and SchedReads that are
/// defined in an instruction definition and which are common across all
/// subtargets. ProcIndices contains 0 for any processor.
///
/// 3) An implied class with a list of InstRW records that map instructions to
/// SchedWrites and SchedReads per-processor. InstrClassMap should map the same
/// instructions to this class. ProcIndices contains all the processors that
/// provided InstrRW records for this class. ItinClassDef or Writes/Reads may
/// still be defined for processors with no InstRW entry.
///
/// 4) An inferred class represents a variant of another class that may be
/// resolved at runtime. ProcIndices contains the set of processors that may
/// require the class. ProcIndices are propagated through SchedClasses as
/// variants are expanded. Multiple SchedClasses may be inferred from an
/// itinerary class. Each inherits the processor index from the ItinRW record
/// that mapped the itinerary class to the variant Writes or Reads.</doc>
