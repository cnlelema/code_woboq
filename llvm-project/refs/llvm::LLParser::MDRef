<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/AsmParser/LLParser.h' l='99'>// Instruction metadata resolution.  Each instruction can have a list of
    // MDRef info associated with them.
    //
    // The simpler approach of just creating temporary MDNodes and then calling
    // RAUW on them when the definition is processed doesn&apos;t work because some
    // instruction metadata kinds, such as dbg, get stored in the IR in an
    // &quot;optimized&quot; format which doesn&apos;t participate in the normal value use
    // lists. This means that RAUW doesn&apos;t work, even on temporary MDNodes
    // which otherwise support RAUW. Instead, we defer resolving MDNode
    // references until the definitions have been processed.</doc>
