/// These values represent a non-pipelined step in
/// the execution of an instruction.  Cycles represents the number of
/// discrete time slots needed to complete the stage.  Units represent
/// the choice of functional units that can be used to complete the
/// stage.  Eg. IntUnit1, IntUnit2. NextCycles indicates how many
/// cycles should elapse from the start of this stage to the start of
/// the next stage in the itinerary. A value of -1 indicates that the
/// next stage should start immediately after the current one.
/// For example:
///
///   { 1, x, -1 }
///      indicates that the stage occupies FU x for 1 cycle and that
///      the next stage starts immediately after this one.
///
///   { 2, x|y, 1 }
///      indicates that the stage occupies either FU x or FU y for 2
///      consecutive cycles and that the next stage starts one cycle
///      after this stage starts. That is, the stage requirements
///      overlap in time.
///
///   { 1, x, 0 }
///      indicates that the stage occupies FU x for 1 cycle and that
///      the next stage starts in this same cycle. This can be used to
///      indicate that the instruction requires multiple stages at the
///      same time.
///
/// FU reservation can be of two different kinds:
///  - FUs which instruction actually requires
///  - FUs which instruction just reserves. Reserved unit is not available for
///    execution of other instruction. However, several instructions can reserve
///    the same unit several times.
/// Such two types of units reservation is used to model instruction domain
/// change stalls, FUs using the same resource (e.g. same register file), etc.</doc>
