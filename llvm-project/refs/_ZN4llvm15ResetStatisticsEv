/// statistics in order to measure a compilation.
///
/// When this function begins to call destructors prior to returning, all
/// statistics will be zero and unregistered. However, that might not remain the
/// case by the time this function finishes returning. Whether update from other
/// threads are lost or merely deferred until during the function return is
/// timing sensitive.

/// Callers who intend to use this to measure statistics for a single
/// compilation should ensure that no compilations are in progress at the point
/// this function is called and that only one compilation executes until calling
/// GetStatistics().</doc>
