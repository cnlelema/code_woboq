<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Sema/ScopeInfo.h' l='496'>// There are three categories of capture: capturing &apos;this&apos;, capturing
  // local variables, and C++1y initialized captures (which can have an
  // arbitrary initializer, and don&apos;t really capture in the traditional
  // sense at all).
  //
  // There are three ways to capture a local variable:
  //  - capture by copy in the C++11 sense,
  //  - capture by reference in the C++11 sense, and
  //  - __block capture.
  // Lambdas explicitly specify capture by copy or capture by reference.
  // For blocks, __block capture applies to variables with that annotation,
  // variables of reference type are captured by reference, and other
  // variables are captured by copy.</doc>
