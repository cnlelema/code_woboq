<doc f='llvm/llvm/tools/llvm-objcopy/MachO/Object.h' l='102'>/// The location of the rebase info inside the binary is described by
/// LC_DYLD_INFO load command. Dyld rebases an image whenever dyld loads it at
/// an address different from its preferred address.  The rebase information is
/// a stream of byte sized opcodes whose symbolic names start with
/// REBASE_OPCODE_. Conceptually the rebase information is a table of tuples:
///   &lt;seg-index, seg-offset, type&gt;
/// The opcodes are a compressed way to encode the table by only
/// encoding when a column changes.  In addition simple patterns
/// like &quot;every n&apos;th offset for m times&quot; can be encoded in a few
/// bytes.</doc>
