  /// We keep track of external definitions and other &apos;interesting&apos; declarations
  /// as we are emitting declarations to the AST file. The AST file contains a
  /// separate record for these declarations, which are provided to the AST
  /// consumer by the AST reader. This is behavior is required to properly cope with,
  /// e.g., tentative variable definitions that occur within
  /// headers. The declarations themselves are stored as declaration
  /// IDs, since they will be written out to an EAGERLY_DESERIALIZED_DECLS
  /// record.</doc>
