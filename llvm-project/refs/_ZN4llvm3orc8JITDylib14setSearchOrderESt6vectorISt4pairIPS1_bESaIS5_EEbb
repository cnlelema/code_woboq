<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Core.h' l='529'>/// Set the search order to be used when fixing up definitions in JITDylib.
  /// This will replace the previous search order, and apply to any symbol
  /// resolutions made for definitions in this JITDylib after the call to
  /// setSearchOrder (even if the definition itself was added before the
  /// call).
  ///
  /// If SearchThisJITDylibFirst is set, which by default it is, then this
  /// JITDylib will add itself to the beginning of the SearchOrder (Clients
  /// should *not* put this JITDylib in the list in this case, to avoid
  /// redundant lookups).
  ///
  /// If SearchThisJITDylibFirst is false then the search order will be used as
  /// given. The main motivation for this feature is to support deliberate
  /// shadowing of symbols in this JITDylib by a facade JITDylib. For example,
  /// the facade may resolve function names to stubs, and the stubs may compile
  /// lazily by looking up symbols in this dylib. Adding the facade dylib
  /// as the first in the search order (instead of this dylib) ensures that
  /// definitions within this dylib resolve to the lazy-compiling stubs,
  /// rather than immediately materializing the definitions in this dylib.</doc>
