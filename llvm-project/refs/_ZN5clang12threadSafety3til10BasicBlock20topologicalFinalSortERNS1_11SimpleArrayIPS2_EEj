<doc f='llvm/clang/lib/Analysis/ThreadSafetyTIL.cpp' l='179'>// Performs a reverse topological traversal, starting from the exit block and
// following back-edges.  The dominator is serialized before any predecessors,
// which guarantees that all blocks are serialized after their dominator and
// before their post-dominator (because it&apos;s a reverse topological traversal).
// ID should be initially set to 0.
//
// This sort assumes that (1) dominators have been computed, (2) there are no
// critical edges, and (3) the entry block is reachable from the exit block
// and no blocks are accessible via traversal of back-edges from the exit that
// weren&apos;t accessible via forward edges from the entry.</doc>
