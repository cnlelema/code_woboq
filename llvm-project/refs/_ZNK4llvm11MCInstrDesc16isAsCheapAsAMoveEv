<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MC/MCInstrDesc.h' l='490'>/// Returns true if this instruction has the same cost (or less) than a
  /// move instruction. This is useful during certain types of optimizations
  /// (e.g., remat during two-address conversion or machine licm) where we would
  /// like to remat or hoist the instruction, but not if it costs more than
  /// moving the instruction into the appropriate register. Note, we are not
  /// marking copies from and to the same register class with this flag.

  /// This method could be called by interface TargetInstrInfo::isAsCheapAsAMove
