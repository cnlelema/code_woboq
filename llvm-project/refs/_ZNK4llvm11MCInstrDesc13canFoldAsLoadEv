  /// in other instructions. The most common use for this is instructions that
  /// are simple loads from memory that don&apos;t modify the loaded value in any
  /// way, but it can also be used for instructions that can be expressed as
  /// constant-pool loads, such as V_SETALLONES on x86, to allow them to be
  /// folded when it is beneficial.  This should only be set on instructions
