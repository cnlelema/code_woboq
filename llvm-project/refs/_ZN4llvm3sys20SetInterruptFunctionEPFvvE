  /// the program (typically by pressing ctrl-c).  When the user interrupts the
  /// program, the specified interrupt function is called instead of the program
  /// being killed, and the interrupt function automatically disabled.  Note

  /// functions.  An null interrupt function pointer disables the current
  /// installed function.  Note also that the handler may be executed on a
