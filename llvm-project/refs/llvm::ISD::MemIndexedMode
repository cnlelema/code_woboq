  /// UNINDEXED    &quot;Normal&quot; load / store. The effective address is already
  ///              computed and is available in the base pointer. The offset
  ///              operand is always undefined. In addition to producing a
  ///              chain, an unindexed load produces one value (result of the
  ///              load); an unindexed store does not produce a value.

  /// PRE_INC      Similar to the unindexed mode where the effective address is
  /// PRE_DEC      the value of the base pointer add / subtract the offset.
  ///              It considers the computation as being folded into the load /
  ///              store operation (i.e. the load / store does the address
  ///              computation as well as performing the memory transaction).
  ///              The base operand is always undefined. In addition to
  ///              producing a chain, pre-indexed load produces two values
  ///              (result of the load and the result of the address
  ///              computation); a pre-indexed store produces one value (result
  ///              of the address computation).
  ///
  /// POST_INC     The effective address is the value of the base pointer. The
  /// POST_DEC     value of the offset operand is then added to / subtracted
  ///              from the base after memory transaction. In addition to
  ///              producing a chain, post-indexed load produces two values
  ///              (the result of the load and the result of the base +/- offset
  ///              computation); a post-indexed store produces one value (the
