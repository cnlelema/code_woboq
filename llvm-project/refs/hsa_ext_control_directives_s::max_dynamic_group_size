<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU/AMDKernelCodeT.h' l='240'>/// If maxDynamicGroupSize is not enabled then must be 0, and any amount of
  /// dynamic group segment can be allocated for a dispatch, otherwise the value
  /// specifies the maximum number of bytes of dynamic group segment that can be
  /// allocated for a dispatch. If the kernel being finalized has any
  /// maxdynamicsize control directives, then the values must be the same, and
  /// must be the same as this argument if it is enabled. This value can be used
  /// by the finalizer to determine the maximum number of bytes of group memory
  /// used by each work-group by adding this value to the group memory required
  /// for all group segment variables used by the kernel and all functions it
  /// calls, and group memory used to implement other HSAIL features such as
  /// fbarriers and the detect exception operations. This can allow the finalizer
  /// to determine the expected number of work-groups that can be executed by a
  /// compute unit and allow more resources to be allocated to the work-items if
  /// it is known that fewer work-groups can be executed due to group memory
  /// limitations.</doc>
