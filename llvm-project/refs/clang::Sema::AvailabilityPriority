<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/Sema/Sema.h' l='2557'>/// Describes the kind of priority given to an availability attribute.
  ///
  /// The sum of priorities deteremines the final priority of the attribute.
  /// The final priority determines how the attribute will be merged.
  /// An attribute with a lower priority will always remove higher priority
  /// attributes for the specified platform when it is being applied. An
  /// attribute with a higher priority will not be applied if the declaration
  /// already has an availability attribute with a lower priority for the
  /// specified platform. The final prirority values are not expected to match
  /// the values in this enumeration, but instead should be treated as a plain
  /// integer value. This enumeration just names the priority weights that are
  /// used to calculate that final vaue.</doc>
