<doc f='llvm/llvm/lib/Transforms/Scalar/SROA.cpp' l='421'>/// An iterator over partitions of the alloca&apos;s slices.
///
/// This iterator implements the core algorithm for partitioning the alloca&apos;s
/// slices. It is a forward iterator as we don&apos;t support backtracking for
/// efficiency reasons, and re-use a single storage area to maintain the
/// current set of split slices.
///
/// It is templated on the slice iterator type to use so that it can operate
/// with either const or non-const slice iterators.</doc>
